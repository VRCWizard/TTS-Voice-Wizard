#### Emoji Addon Instructions:
-  This feature allows for any words that you have pre defined in the emoji tab to be converted in to emojis with Killfrenzy Avatar Text.
    -  when editing the character texture sheet keep in mind that emojis are 2 characters long and they are numbered from left to right (skipping the heart and spotify emoji, so the crying face emoji would be emoji 1 for example)
-  In unity replace the KAT texture with the replacement texture sheet provided (in the KAT Emoji Texture Sheet folder provided in each download) and enable emojis addon in the app.
